  "text": "At Disney, I was the Product Designer for the \"Disney Sneak Peek\" project, an initiative to revolutionize media content-sharing across studio teams. Over a year, I spearheaded the design of an interactive desktop app that addressed key challenges in content-sharing, utilizing tools like Figma and Adobe Suite. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, the goal was to provide a user-centric design that streamlined communication, enhanced user experience and incorporated secure features such as direct links for celebrity home screenings. The outcome was a successful and efficient platform that met the media content-sharing needs of Disney's creative teams.",
